## A Comprehensive study of Tmeporal Learner Modelling using Purely Neural Networks (XGBoost, LSTM, Transformers) and NeuroSymbolic Model (GNN+Symbolic engine) for Knowledge Tracing

### Dataset
[Click link for ASSISTments dataset ](https://osf.io/7cgav/files/osfstorage)

### Problem Statement
On the basis of a student's capabiility to answer questions from various metrics like problem type, time taken, tutoring type and 30 or so features, what is the probability of him/her to answer the next question correctly? 

### Tentative Approach
We can use sequential models like lstm, transformers or rnn for this because the order matters.
For the symbolic part, we can use fuzzy logic based on various metrics.
